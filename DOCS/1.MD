`this is how it gonna work:`

You enter a search phrase "fanny.bmp" for example,
The script(it) will search github for "fanny.bmp" but not only that,
it will also - among other things - also change language and search that in e.g japanese (for example) -- (like in my [AI-SNN](https://github.com/loneicewolf/AI-SNN) 
*which I have to admit, is not entirely complete yet*).

but the different thing with **this script** and with **AI-SNN** is that *this* script will only search github (therefore, you could say
it's a *more focused* *!* script.
